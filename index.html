            Hivecom is a community of friends from all around Europe. Playing video games and creating things together.
            We are always happy to welcome anyone willing to join and hang out. We host some gaming servers as well as
            regular hangouts on teamspeak.

            Hivecom is a gaming community run by folks from all around the world. We're a constantly growing group open
            to those willing to join. Our servers were initially hosted locally, but as sub communities and friends of
            friends joined we started building more advanced systems. As mentioned, people from all around the world are
            known visitors of our servers. The range goes from countries like New Zealand, over to all of Europe and
            across to North America.

          <h4>About us</h4>

          <p>
            The community was originally created by the three server administrators: Catlinman, Jokler and Trif. All
            three started hosting a server back in 2013 on a local machine but the growing demand for a better
            connection and 24/7 uptime made them reconsider this small hosting plan. They later on that year went over
            to actually acquiring a dedicated Teamspeak server from Fragnet but later on switched to what is now a
            server entirely run and managed for Hivecom in itself. <br /><br />

          <h4>In retrospect</h4>
          <p>
            Hivecom wouldn't be anything without its members though. The server now has a total of about 400 registered
            members and is constantly growing. We're incredibly thankful for what we have now considering this all
            started with three friends getting together to chat and hang out.
            <br /><br />

            Stay awesome!

          Becoming registered can be done quite fast. You can just ask. The moderator or administrator should then
          ideally assign you to the registered server group allowing you to enter the main area of the Hivecom Teamspeak
          server.
